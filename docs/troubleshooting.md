<summary>Docker Image Pull Issues</summary>

* If you get a 401 or 403 error when pulling the image from GHCR, this is not a permission issue with the repository/image. It errors because your Docker client is misconfigured.

**Possible Fixes:**

* [Unable to pull image from GitHub Container Registry (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74656167/unable-to-pull-image-from-github-container-registry-ghcr)
* [Try pulling the image from Quay.io](installation/docker.md#docker-images)
