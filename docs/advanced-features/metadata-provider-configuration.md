# Metadata Provider Configuration

## Metadata Provider Configuration

Metadata provider settings are configured in the `[metadata]` section of your `config.toml` file. These settings control how MediaManager retrieves information about movies and TV shows.

### General Settings (`[metadata]`)

* `refetch_interval_hours`\
  Minimum number of hours that must pass since a movie/show's metadata was last fetched before it is refetched again. This applies both to the automatic refresh on application startup and the weekly scheduled refresh. Default is `24`. Example: `72`.

### TMDB Settings (`[metadata.tmdb]`)

TMDB (The Movie Database) is the primary metadata provider for MediaManager. It provides detailed information about movies and TV shows.

!!! info
    Other software like Jellyfin use TMDB as well, so there won't be any metadata discrepancies.

* `tmdb_relay_url`\
  URL of the TMDB relay (MetadataRelay). Default is `https://metadata-relay.dorninger.co/tmdb`. Example: `https://your-own-relay.example.com/tmdb`.
* `primary_languages`\
  If the original language of a show/movie is in this list, metadata is fetched in that language. Otherwise, `default_language` is used. Default is `[]`. Example: `["no", "de", "es"]`. Format: ISO 639-1 (2 letters). Full list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_ISO\_639\_language\_codes
* `default_language`\
  TMDB language parameter used when searching and adding. Default is `en`. Format: ISO 639-1 (2 letters).

!!! warning
    `default_language` sets the TMDB `language` parameter when searching and adding TV shows and movies. If TMDB does not find a matching translation, metadata in the original language will be fetched with no option for a fallback language. It is therefore highly advised to only use "broad" languages. For most use cases, the default setting is safest.

### TVDB Settings (`[metadata.tvdb]`)

!!! warning
    The TVDB might provide false metadata and doesn't support some features of MediaManager like showing overviews. Therefore, TMDB is the preferred metadata provider.

* `tvdb_relay_url`\
  URL of the TVDB relay (MetadataRelay). Default is `https://metadata-relay.dorninger.co/tvdb`. Example: `https://your-own-relay.example.com/tvdb`.

### MetadataRelay

!!! info
    To use MediaManager you don't need to set up your own MetadataRelay, as the default relay hosted by the developer should be sufficient for most purposes.

The MetadataRelay is a service that provides metadata for MediaManager. It acts as a proxy for TMDB and TVDB, allowing you to use your own API keys if needed, but the default relay means you don't need to create accounts for API keys yourself.

You might want to use your own relay if you want to avoid rate limits, protect your privacy, or for other reasons. If you know Sonarr's Skyhook, this is similar to that.

#### Where to get API keys

* Get a TMDB API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
* Get a TVDB API key from [The TVDB](https://thetvdb.com/auth/register)

!!! info
    If you want to use your own MetadataRelay, you can set the `tmdb_relay_url` and/or `tvdb_relay_url` to your own relay service.

### Example Configuration

Here's a complete example of the metadata section in your `config.toml`:

```toml title="config.toml"
[metadata]
    refetch_interval_hours = 24

    # TMDB configuration
    [metadata.tmdb]
    tmdb_relay_url = "https://metadata-relay.dorninger.co/tmdb"

    # TVDB configuration
    [metadata.tvdb]
    tvdb_relay_url = "https://metadata-relay.dorninger.co/tvdb"
```

!!! info
    In most cases, you can simply use the default values and don't need to specify these settings in your config file at all.
